Microbe
=======

Microbe is easy to use Artificial Neural Network library.
Project started in June 2014 so give it a time please! :)

Project goals:
* easy to understand, flexible architecture
* clear, object oriented code
* well tested by unit tests


Currently library supports:
* multi layer feed forward networks
* training:
    * back propagation of error
    * adaptive learning rate
* several transfer functions:
    * linear
    * step
    * hyperbolic tangent
    * sigmoid
* converting data to form suitable for neural networks:
    * images
